## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

- I learned that for an item to be aligned vertically in a flex system, width of the parent element needs to be specified

- To reduce the height of an element in a flex-box, set to column. Specify the max-height of the specific element.

### Continued development

I really hope to get better at using flex box for complex designs and follow best practices for DOM manipulation.
